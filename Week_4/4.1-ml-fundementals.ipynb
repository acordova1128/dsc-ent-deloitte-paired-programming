    "Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a treatable condition, but measuring blood pressure requires specialized equipment that most people do not have at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question, then, is ***can we predict blood pressure using just a scale and a tape measure***? These measuring tools, which individuals are more likely to have at home, might be able to flag individuals with an increased risk of hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Researchers in Brazil](https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/637635) collected data from several hundred college students in order to answer this question. We will be specifically using the data they collected from female students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurements we have are:\n",

    "* Age (age in years)\n",
    "* BMI (body mass index, a ratio of weight to height)\n",

    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Perform a Train-Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the data into a dataframe using pandas, separate the features (`X`) from the target (`y`), and use the `train_test_split` function to separate data into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Build and Evaluate a First Simple Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `LinearRegression` model and `mean_squared_error` function from scikit-learn, build and evaluate a simple linear regression model using the training data. Also, use `cross_val_score` to simulate unseen data, without actually using the holdout test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Use `PolynomialFeatures` to Reduce Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply a `PolynomialFeatures` transformer to give the model more ability to pick up on information from the training data. Test out different polynomial degrees until you have a model that is perfectly fit to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Use Regularization to Reduce Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of a basic `LinearRegression`, use a `Ridge` regression model to apply regularization to the overfit model. In order to do this you will need to scale the data. Test out different regularization penalties to find the best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Evaluate a Final Model on the Test Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocess `X_test` and `y_test` appropriately in order to evaluate the performance of your final model on unseen data."

    "<details>\n",

    "\n",
    "A machine learning (predictive) workflow fundamentally emphasizes creating *a model that will perform well on unseen data*. We will hold out a subset of our original data as the \"test\" set that will stand in for truly unseen data that the model will encounter in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make this separation as the first step for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Most importantly, we are avoiding *leakage* of information from the test set into the training set. Leakage can lead to inflated metrics, since the model has information about the \"unseen\" data that it won't have about real unseen data. This is why we always want to fit our transformers and models on the training data only, not the full dataset.\n",
    "2. Also, we want to make sure the code we have written will actually work on unseen data. If we are able to transform our test data and evaluate it with our final model, that's a good sign that the same process will work for future data as well.\n",

However, it also increased variance (increased overfitting). We can tell because the RMSE increased on the validation dataset compared to the train dataset.\n",

    "Essentially this means that the polynomial features transformation gave our model the ability to pick up on more information from the training dataset, but some of that information was actually \"noise\" and not information that was useful for making predictions on unseen data.\n",

    "In general, as the true blood pressure values increase, so do the predicted blood pressure values. So, it's clear that our model is picking up on *some* information from our features.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it looks like this model does not actually solve the initial business problem very well. Recall that our question was: ***can we predict blood pressure using just a scale and a tape measure?*** Our model would incorrectly flag one person as being at risk of high blood pressure, while missing all of the people who actually are at risk of high blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that some other model algorithm (e.g. k-nearest neighbors or decision trees) would do a better job of picking up on the underlying patterns in this dataset. Or if we set this up as a classification problem rather than a regression problem, if we're only interested in flagging high blood pressure rather than predicting blood pressure in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we had to stop this analysis now in its current state, we would need to conclude that **while we were able to pick up some information about blood pressure using these variables alone, we did not produce a model that would work for this business case**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is something that happens sometimes — not every target can be predicted with the features you have been given! In this case, maybe your model would still be useful for epidemiological modeling (predicting the blood pressure in populations) rather than predicting blood pressure for an individual, since we are picking up on some information. Further study would be needed to determine the feasibility of this approach."
